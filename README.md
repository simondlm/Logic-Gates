# Logic Gate Simulator
 A hardware interpretation of RTL Logic Gates, created in the Eurorack style. 
 
 The project currently has four modules:
 
 ## Power In (Workable)
 This board accepts a standard DC barrel jack and outputs power via pin headers on the reverse of the PCB. 
 The manner of power distribution is simply for convenience whilst testing a suitable input output method
 
 ## Four Power Outlet (Workable)
 This board is a 4-signal output board, to act as inputs for other boards
 
 ## 555 Timer (Workable)
 This board is a controllable oscillator powered by the mighty 555 timer chip in astable mode. The schematic uses a 10k resistor, 100k potentiometer, and 4.7uF capacitor to set a frequency between 'always-on' and approximately 1.5Hz. User choice will be able to change this
 
 ## NOR Gate (Non-working)
 This board acts as a two-input NOR Gate. Current footprinting is incorrect.
